My project is geared towards answering the following question: to what extent does the mental well-being of students in the United States affect their academic performance? [*insert joke about how everyone is smart here*]

Data sources: 
For the mental health: [[https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/results/index.html]]
For scores: [[https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_226.40.asp]]
