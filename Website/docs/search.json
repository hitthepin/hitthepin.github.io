With the increase in the severity in this crisis has apparently come an increase in awareness and resources available to help meet it, however.

    "text": "Data Description\nSAT data was gathered from this site: [[https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_226.40.asp]], while ACT data was gathered from this site: [[https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/2021/2021-Average-ACT-Scores-by-State.pdf]]. The information on standardized test performances comes from the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal statistics agency whose entire job it is to collect data related to educational results. They state that their data comes from College Board, the organization that runs the SAT. The data about the ACT comes from act.org itself.\nTo supplement this information, pre-COVID data about the SAT Scores by state were gathered from Kaggle: [[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/us-school-scores]].\nFor the mental health: [[https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/results/index.html]], then follow to “Youth Online High School Results” and “Unintentional Injuries and Violence”. The CDC is the Center for Disease Control, an American public health institution. As their stated mission is to protect and improve public health in the country, mental illnesses fall under their jurisdiction, which is why data on mental health was collected by the organization. From the CDC’s “Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System”, I initially began using the proportion of high school students in 2021 who “felt sad or hopeless” in order to represent overall mental well-being of students. The “Youth Online”’s main page says that their data is collected from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS), a survey organized by the World Health Organization to “provide accurate data on health behaviors and protective factors among students” [[https://www.who.int/teams/noncommunicable-diseases/surveillance/systems-tools/global-school-based-student-health-survey/methodology]].\nIn addition to this, I am also using other statistics gathered by the YRBSS. These include the percentage of surveyed high schoolers who actually attempted suicide, the percentage who were not getting 8 or more hours of sleep, and the percentage who reported that they were binge drinking. These factors were selected out of the many different YRBSS surveys due to all of them commonly being associated with\n\ntest_scores2021 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/aaronskim/Documents/Math 437/Data/standardized_test_scores.xlsx\") \nsad_percent2021 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/aaronskim/Documents/Math 437/Data/felt_sad_2021.xlsx\")\n\n\ndata2021 &lt;- test_scores2021[4:54, 1:3]\ndata2021[, 4] &lt;- sad_percent2021[5:55, 2]\ncolnames(data2021)[4] &lt;- \"Sadness\"\n\ndata2021\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 4\n   State                  SAT   ACT Sadness\n   &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1 Alabama               1159  18.7 36.9   \n 2 Alaska                1119  20.6 &lt;NA&gt;   \n 3 Arizona               1181  19.8 &lt;NA&gt;   \n 4 Arkansas              1194  19   42.9   \n 5 California            1057  26.1 &lt;NA&gt;   \n 6 Colorado              1072  23.6 41.7   \n 7 Connecticut           1072  27.2 35.6   \n 8 Delaware               984  25.7 36.9   \n 9 District of Columbia   987  25.6 36.3   \n10 Florida                993  20.4 39.3   \n# ℹ 41 more rows\n\n\n\nData Limitations"
