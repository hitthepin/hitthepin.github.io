    "text": "Data Description\nSAT data was gathered from this site: [[https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_226.40.asp]], while ACT data was gathered from this site: [[https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/2021/2021-Average-ACT-Scores-by-State.pdf]]. The information on standardized test performances comes from the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal statistics agency whose entire job it is to collect data related to educational results. They state that their data comes from College Board, the organization that runs the SAT. The data about the ACT comes from act.org itself.\nTo supplement this information, pre-COVID data about the SAT Scores by state were gathered from Kaggle: [[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/us-school-scores]].\nFor the mental health: [[https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/results/index.html]], then follow to “Youth Online High School Results” and “Unintentional Injuries and Violence”. The CDC is the Center for Disease Control, an American public health institution. As their stated mission is to protect and improve public health in the country, mental illnesses fall under their jurisdiction, which is why data on mental health was collected by the organization. From the CDC’s “Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System” (YRBSS), I initially began using the proportion of high school students in 2021 who “felt sad or hopeless” in order to represent overall mental well-being of students. The “Youth Online”’s main page says that their data is collected from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS), a survey organized by the World Health Organization to “provide accurate data on health behaviors and protective factors among students” [[https://www.who.int/teams/noncommunicable-diseases/surveillance/systems-tools/global-school-based-student-health-survey/methodology]].\nIn addition to this, I am also using other statistics gathered by the YRBSS. These include the percentage of surveyed high schoolers who actually attempted suicide, the percentage who were not getting 8 or more hours of sleep, and the percentage who reported that they were binge drinking. These factors were selected out of the many different YRBSS surveys due to all of them commonly being commonly associated with poor mental health. I expect for the percentage of students who answered “yes” to these questions to increase alongside the percentage of students who report feeling sad or hopeless.\n\ntest_scores2021 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/aaronskim/Documents/Math 437/Data/standardized_test_scores.xlsx\") \nsad_percent2021 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/aaronskim/Documents/Math 437/Data/felt_sad_2021.xlsx\")\nattempt_suicide2021 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/aaronskim/Documents/Math 437/Data/AttemptedSuicide2021.xlsx\")\nbinge_drinking2021 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/aaronskim/Documents/Math 437/Data/BingeDrinking2021.xlsx\")\nsleeping_enough2021 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/aaronskim/Documents/Math 437/Data/Sleeping8Hours2021.xlsx\")\n\n\ndata2021 &lt;- test_scores2021[4:54, 1:3]\ndata2021[, 4] &lt;- sad_percent2021[5:55, 2]\ncolnames(data2021)[4] &lt;- \"Sadness\"\n\ndata2021[, 5] &lt;- sleeping_enough2021[5:55, 2]\ncolnames(data2021)[5] &lt;- \"Not_Sleeping_Enough\"\n\ndata2021[, 6] &lt;- attempt_suicide2021[5:55, 2]\ncolnames(data2021)[6] &lt;- \"Attempted_Suicide\"\n\ndata2021[, 7] &lt;- sad_percent2021[5:55, 2]\ncolnames(data2021)[7] &lt;- \"Binge_Drinkers\"\n\ndata2021$Sadness &lt;- as.numeric(data2021$Sadness)\ndata2021$Not_Sleeping_Enough &lt;- as.numeric(data2021$Not_Sleeping_Enough)\ndata2021$Attempted_Suicide &lt;- as.numeric(data2021$Attempted_Suicide)\ndata2021$Binge_Drinkers &lt;- as.numeric(data2021$Binge_Drinkers)\n\ndata2021\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 7\n   State                 SAT   ACT Sadness Not_Sleeping_Enough Attempted_Suicide\n   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Alabama              1159  18.7    36.9                77.4              NA  \n 2 Alaska               1119  20.6    NA                  NA                NA  \n 3 Arizona              1181  19.8    NA                  79.3              10.4\n 4 Arkansas             1194  19      42.9                77.8              10.4\n 5 California           1057  26.1    NA                  NA                NA  \n 6 Colorado             1072  23.6    41.7                75.6              11.9\n 7 Connecticut          1072  27.2    35.6                78.6               5.9\n 8 Delaware              984  25.7    36.9                80.1               8.7\n 9 District of Columb…   987  25.6    36.3                NA                NA  \n10 Florida               993  20.4    39.3                78.4               8.9\n# ℹ 41 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: Binge_Drinkers &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\n\nData Limitations\nOne of the more pertinent limitations to this data is the fact that not every high school student takes standardized tests such as the ACT and SAT. These tests are usually taken by students who intend to pursue higher education (college). They are not mandatory, and not every high schoolers takes them. Therefore, whatever conclusions drawn from this data cannot be applied to high schoolers as a whole - only this specific group of high schoolers.\nAdditionally, the YRBSS data possesses is incomplete - it is missing data for a few different states. This can be worked around reasonably via data imputation, however, it is still a potential issue worth noting.\nFinally, the survey-based data collection of the YRBSS (as described here: [[https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/methods/index.html]]) means that biases may appear in its data collection. For example, some of the students surveyed may have responded dishonestly. On top of this, observational studies such as these surveys cannot prove causation. Even if some connection between test scores is seen within the data, it will not prove that one is caused by the other. Perhaps lowered test scores cause depression, perhaps a worsened mood causes a lack of motivation and lower test scores, or perhaps some combination of these is true - however, this analysis cannot determinen which of these is true."

I will make use of linear model imputation in order to do this. Linear imputation is appropriate here, since this data appears to be a case missing completely at random - there is no pattern among the states with missing data or commonality that they all share. The data is most likely missing due to surveyors not being particularly active in these states or some other fluke, rather than because of the impact of the variable of mental health itself (excluding

Beginning with test scores, we have the SAT and ACT:\n\nggplot(data = data2021_final,\n       mapping = aes(x = SAT)\n) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = data2021_final,\n       mapping = aes(x = ACT)\n) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn initial overview of the distributions of SAT and ACT scores does not reveal any extreme outliers or unusual data points. Both distributions are somewhat irregular - they are not normal, uniform, or otherwise following a commonly distribution. Additionally, both data sets have multiple “peaks” (modes). The ACT notably appears to have two nodes, one at 20.0 and another at 25.0.\nWe will now examine the imputed data:\n\nggplot(data = data2021_final,\n       mapping = aes(x = Sadness)\n) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = data2021_final,\n       mapping = aes(x = Not_Sleeping_Enough)\n) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = data2021_final,\n       mapping = aes(x = Attempted_Suicide)\n) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = data2021_final,\n       mapping = aes(x = Binge_Drinkers)\n) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, all of the distributions for each of the four critera appear to be fairly close to normal, in spite of their differing centers. They also appear to have roughly similar rangers, except for “Attempted_Suicide”, which is slightly lower."

That is, an increase in test scores should precipiate a decrease in the percentage of people suffering from various indications of mental health issues.\nDue to this, I will test whether a linear relationship between test scores and these mental health indicators. I am doing this under the assumption that worsening mental health causes worse test scores at a linear rate - a drop in mental health will result in a drop in academic performance, regardless of whether you were originally perfectly fine or in the throes of depression. I will create a model for both the SAT and the ACT model.\n\nset.seed(437)\n\nsample_index &lt;- sample(seq_len(51), size = 41)\ntrain_data2021 &lt;- data2021_final[sample_index,]\ntest_data2021 &lt;- data2021_final[-sample_index,]\n\n\nSAT_linearmodel &lt;- lm(SAT ~ Sadness + Not_Sleeping_Enough + Attempted_Suicide + Binge_Drinkers, data = train_data2021)\n\n\nACT_linearmodel &lt;- lm(ACT ~ Sadness + Not_Sleeping_Enough + Attempted_Suicide + Binge_Drinkers, data = train_data2021)\n\nA residuals vs. fitted plot for each of the models gives us the following:\n\nplot(SAT_linearmodel, 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(ACT_linearmodel, 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that in both of these plots that a notable amount of curvature within the LOESS smoother (the red line).

This calls into question the veracity of a linear relationship - it is not an adequate way to describe the relationship between mental health indicators with the test scores."

An examination of both these values and the residual graphs above lead to the conclusion that a linear model is inadequate for describing the relationship between test scores and the selected mental health indicators.\n\nLimitations and Future Work\nOne of the limitations that may be at play here is in the stanardized test scores data. Here is a graph of the data I found showing the SAT scores vs. the ACT scores. Each dot represents one of the fifty states (and the District of Columbia) during the year of 2021:\n\nggplot(data = data2021_final, aes(x = SAT, y = ACT)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBizarrely, there appears to be no relationship between the two sets of test scores at all - in fact, the (highly inaccurate) line of best fit claims that there is an inverse relationship between the two variables! This is highly counterintuitive, as one would expect these scores to be directly correlated - an increase in one ought to see an increase in the other, as better students perform better on tests in general. This leads me to suspect that either one or both of the test score data sets is inaccurate, or that each survey examined a different part of each state’s population such that there was little to no overlap. Either way, the above result may be partly causing the lack of any meaningful correlation between the examined variables. If I were to do this again, I would make absolutely certain that the test score data was being drawn from as reliable of a source as possible.\nAdditionally, in this analysis I have made some assumptions that a deteriorating mental health has a simple, straightforward relationship (linear) that can be represented using common methods. This is, of course, a very big assumption. The human mind’s relationship with these test scores may not be subject to any common, simple kind of relationship at all.\n\n\nReflection (Optional Subsection)\n(Reflection included in Canvas submission)"

More than a few times during this period of my life, I said to myself “It would really be nice if there was someone who I could talk to about all this.” Though thankfully I’ve managed to achieve a much healthier balance in my life since entering college, I still retain an interest in the mental health of students, which is why I chose to center my project on them.\nIt is commonly said that America today is in a mental health crisis - the CDC states that a staggering one in five Americans suffer from anxiety or depression, with the youth being even more severely effected [https://www.cdc.gov/mental-health/about/what-cdc-is-doing.html]. With the increase in the severity in this crisis has apparently come an increase in awareness and resources available to help meet it, however. In this project I intend to only cover mental health issues and educational results that are common and familiar to the average person (i.e., depression and anxiety for mental health, and standardized test scores for educational results). Thus, no additional context is required for a general audience to understand the concepts at play."

    "text": "Data Description\nSAT data was gathered from this site: [[https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_226.40.asp]], while ACT data was gathered from this site: [[https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/2021/2021-Average-ACT-Scores-by-State.pdf]]. The information on standardized test performances comes from the National Center for Education Statistics, a federal statistics agency whose entire job it is to collect data related to educational results. They state that their data comes from College Board, the organization that runs the SAT. The data about the ACT comes from act.org itself.\nTo supplement this information, pre-COVID data about the SAT Scores by state were gathered from Kaggle: [[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/us-school-scores]].\nFor the mental health: [[https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/results/index.html]], then follow to “Youth Online High School Results” and “Unintentional Injuries and Violence”. The CDC is the Center for Disease Control, an American public health institution. As their stated mission is to protect and improve public health in the country, mental illnesses fall under their jurisdiction, which is why data on mental health was collected by the organization. From the CDC’s “Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System”, I initially began using the proportion of high school students in 2021 who “felt sad or hopeless” in order to represent overall mental well-being of students. The “Youth Online”’s main page says that their data is collected from the Global School-Based Student Health Survey (GSHS), a survey organized by the World Health Organization to “provide accurate data on health behaviors and protective factors among students” [[https://www.who.int/teams/noncommunicable-diseases/surveillance/systems-tools/global-school-based-student-health-survey/methodology]].\nIn addition to this, I am also using other statistics gathered by the YRBSS. These include the percentage of surveyed high schoolers who actually attempted suicide, the percentage who were not getting 8 or more hours of sleep, and the percentage who reported that they were binge drinking. These factors were selected out of the many different YRBSS surveys due to all of them commonly being associated with\n\ntest_scores2021 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/aaronskim/Documents/Math 437/Data/standardized_test_scores.xlsx\") \nsad_percent2021 &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/aaronskim/Documents/Math 437/Data/felt_sad_2021.xlsx\")\n\n\ndata2021 &lt;- test_scores2021[4:54, 1:3]\ndata2021[, 4] &lt;- sad_percent2021[5:55, 2]\ncolnames(data2021)[4] &lt;- \"Sadness\"\n\ndata2021\n\n# A tibble: 51 × 4\n   State                  SAT   ACT Sadness\n   &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n 1 Alabama               1159  18.7 36.9   \n 2 Alaska                1119  20.6 &lt;NA&gt;   \n 3 Arizona               1181  19.8 &lt;NA&gt;   \n 4 Arkansas              1194  19   42.9   \n 5 California            1057  26.1 &lt;NA&gt;   \n 6 Colorado              1072  23.6 41.7   \n 7 Connecticut           1072  27.2 35.6   \n 8 Delaware               984  25.7 36.9   \n 9 District of Columbia   987  25.6 36.3   \n10 Florida                993  20.4 39.3   \n# ℹ 41 more rows\n\n\n\nData Limitations"
